Steps to recreate
Weird | Formatting
Write letter = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F";
Press Alt+Shift+F
It now for some reason removed all the spaces before the |
So now it would be letter = "A"| "B"| "C"| "D"| "E"| "F";

Not being able to write "\"
Write a term like "\\", "\\\\\\", '\\', "\", '\', '\\\\', it literally doesn't matter how many backslashes
Press Alt+Shift+F
Now it just completely deleted all the \ inside the terms

letter = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F";
